/**
 * Shell-Sort, also known as Shell sort or Shell's method, is an in-place comparison sort.
 * It is mainly a variation of Insertion Sort. In insertion sort, we move elements only one position ahead.
 * When an element has to be moved far ahead, many movements are involved. The idea of ShellSort is to allow the exchange of far items.
 * In Shell-sort, we make the array h-sorted for a large value of h. We keep reducing the value of h until it becomes 1.
 * An array is said to be h-sorted if all sub-lists of every hâ€™th element are sorted.
